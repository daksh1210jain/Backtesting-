# EMA Crossover Strategy Backtesting
This project implements a simple yet effective Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Crossover Strategy for trading stocks. The strategy uses two EMAs of different periods (e.g., 20-day and 50-day) on the adjusted close price of a stock to identify buy and sell signals. A backtesting framework is set up to evaluate the performance of this strategy against a traditional buy-and-hold approach over a specified period.

Project Overview
Objective
To develop a trading strategy based on the crossover of two EMAs and evaluate its performance through backtesting on historical stock data. The project includes:

Calculating EMAs of varying periods.
Generating buy/sell signals based on EMA crossovers.
Calculating and comparing the cumulative returns of the strategy to a buy-and-hold approach.
Strategy Description
The EMA Crossover Strategy generates signals as follows:

Buy: When the short-term EMA (e.g., 20-day) crosses above the long-term EMA (e.g., 50-day), signaling upward momentum.
Sell: When the short-term EMA crosses below the long-term EMA, signaling downward momentum.
Positions are held until the opposite crossover occurs.

Key Features
Historical Data Download: Automatically downloads historical price data for the selected stock from Yahoo Finance.
Buy and Sell Signal Generation: Identifies buy and sell points based on EMA crossovers.
Performance Metrics: Calculates daily and cumulative returns for both buy-and-hold and strategy-based trades.
Visualization: Plots cumulative returns of the EMA strategy versus buy-and-hold returns for easy comparison.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
The following Python libraries are required:

pandas - for data manipulation and analysis
numpy - for numerical calculations
yfinance - for fetching historical stock data
matplotlib - for plotting results
Install them via:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy yfinance matplotlib
Usage
Define Parameters: Set your desired stock ticker and date range.
Run the Code: Execute the script to generate buy/sell signals and calculate cumulative returns.
Analyze the Results: View the cumulative returns plot to compare the strategy's performance to buy-and-hold.
Example Code
python
Copy code
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for the selected stock
ticker = 'MSFT'
_start = '2015-01-02'
_end = '2020-04-30'
df = yf.download(ticker, start=_start, end=_end)

# Calculate EMAs and generate signals
short_ema = 20
long_ema = 50
df['EMA_20'] = df['Adj Close'].ewm(span=short_ema, adjust=False).mean()
df['EMA_50'] = df['Adj Close'].ewm(span=long_ema, adjust=False).mean()
df['Signal'] = np.where(df['EMA_20'] > df['EMA_50'], 1, 0)
df['Position'] = df['Signal'].shift(1)
df['bnh_returns'] = np.log(df['Adj Close'] / df['Adj Close'].shift(1))
df['strategy_returns'] = df['Position'] * df['bnh_returns']
df['cumulative_bnh_returns'] = df['bnh_returns'].cumsum().apply(np.exp)
df['cumulative_strategy_returns'] = df['strategy_returns'].cumsum().apply(np.exp)

# Plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(df['cumulative_bnh_returns'], label='Buy-and-Hold Returns')
plt.plot(df['cumulative_strategy_returns'], label='EMA Strategy Returns')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Cumulative Returns')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
Results Interpretation
Cumulative Buy-and-Hold Returns: Shows how the stock performed if held without trading.
Cumulative Strategy Returns: Shows the performance of the EMA strategy. If the cumulative returns of this strategy are higher, it indicates that the strategy has successfully outperformed buy-and-hold.
Future Improvements
Add additional technical indicators for more advanced strategies.
Implement risk management and position sizing to improve the strategyâ€™s robustness.
Conduct further backtesting over different stocks and market conditions.
