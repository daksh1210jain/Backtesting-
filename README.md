# EMA Crossover Strategy Backtesting
This project implements a simple yet effective Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Crossover Strategy for trading stocks. The strategy uses two EMAs of different periods (e.g., 20-day and 50-day) on the adjusted close price of a stock to identify buy and sell signals. A backtesting framework is set up to evaluate the performance of this strategy against a traditional buy-and-hold approach over a specified period.

Project Overview
Objective
To develop a trading strategy based on the crossover of two EMAs and evaluate its performance through backtesting on historical stock data. The project includes:

Calculating EMAs of varying periods.
Generating buy/sell signals based on EMA crossovers.
Calculating and comparing the cumulative returns of the strategy to a buy-and-hold approach.
Strategy Description
The EMA Crossover Strategy generates signals as follows:

Buy: When the short-term EMA (e.g., 20-day) crosses above the long-term EMA (e.g., 50-day), signaling upward momentum.
Sell: When the short-term EMA crosses below the long-term EMA, signaling downward momentum.
Positions are held until the opposite crossover occurs.

Key Features
Historical Data Download: Automatically downloads historical price data for the selected stock from Yahoo Finance.
Buy and Sell Signal Generation: Identifies buy and sell points based on EMA crossovers.
Performance Metrics: Calculates daily and cumulative returns for both buy-and-hold and strategy-based trades.
Visualization: Plots cumulative returns of the EMA strategy versus buy-and-hold returns for easy comparison.

Results Interpretation
Cumulative Buy-and-Hold Returns: Shows how the stock performed if held without trading.
Cumulative Strategy Returns: Shows the performance of the EMA strategy. If the cumulative returns of this strategy are higher, it indicates that the strategy has successfully outperformed buy-and-hold.
Future Improvements
Add additional technical indicators for more advanced strategies.
Implement risk management and position sizing to improve the strategyâ€™s robustness.
Conduct further backtesting over different stocks and market conditions.
